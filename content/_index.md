# Forge On

The **Digital Forge Team** is a collection of 25 talented individuals that have
worked together over the past 5 years to put together some amazing technology for
their parent company.  In 2022, our parent company elected to shut down this
unique experiment and offshore the work.  This website documents our public 
work, our collaborative and caring culture, and our innovative and energized spirit.  
It is our hope that you find great people here that would fit in your own organization 
and help you forge the future.


# Our Mission

Digitize an industrial engineering company by infusing products and services with
digital technology.  This required working in highly regulated industries (such as 
medical, and energy), and required high quality engineering with meticulous attention
to detail, robust and cyber-secure solutions, and an agile approach.  


# Our Origin

>To support our ambitions, we opened
>our first Digital Forge in the San
>Francisco Bay area in FY2018, designed
>to accelerate our digital projects and
>provide a co-innovation space for us,
>our customers and other partners.
>We also held workshops throughout
>the year to drive innovative thinking,
>identify and develop solutions for future
>problems, and collaborate on forward
>thinking technologies

# Our Accomplishments


From the Smiths Annual Report 2021: https://www.smiths.com/-/media/files/smiths-annual-report-2021-report.pdf

– At the Smiths Digital Forge, focus on
physical cybersecurity; embedded
technology for wireless sensor
networks; and augmented analytics
capabilities in the cloud (see page 35)
– John Crane SenseTM condition-based
seal monitoring technology is connected
by a digital interface developed by the
Smiths Digital Forge. Products being
developed under the methane detection
programme are also driven by
technology developed by the Forge
which will enable methane sensors to be
deployed anywhere
