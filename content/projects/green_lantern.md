Green Lantern was a platform for continuously monitoring methane emissions and providing a steady stream
of methane measurements to the cloud.

The Forge Team

- Developed the concept 
- Researched sensor candidates
- Developed a methane-compatible packaging environment
- Developed the hardware interface circuitry using the Nordic NRF SoC
- Wrote the RTOS code to read the sensor and send telemetry to the gateway
- Developed battery management software to extend the life of the cell
- Developed the gateway software to record the methane measurements along with key metadata
- Send the telemetry to the cloud using the hardened gateway developed for [John_Crane_Sense](@/projects/sense.md)
- Built prototypes and test equipment
