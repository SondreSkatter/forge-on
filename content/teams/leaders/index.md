Samit is the Chief Digital Officer of [Smiths](www.smiths.com) and is working to facilitate the digital transformation of the Smiths businesses as we transform ourselves into a leading technology company.  In the past 5 years, he has architected, built and lead the Smiths Digital Forge – a center of excellence for digital technology for Smiths consisting of a dynamic, creative and motivated team of hardware, software, and data engineers that work together to bring new capabilities to Smiths product offerings.   Under Samit’s leadership, the SDF has delivered market-ready technologies to the different divisions of Smiths, including a complete software and firmware stack for a smart infusion pump, minimum viable product demonstrators for condition monitoring of seals in the oil and gas space, a cyber secure, hazardous location certified industrial IoT gateway, and networked sensor solutions for commercial and residential ducting.  Prior to joining Smiths in 2017, Samit was the CTO of the legacy Morpho Detection business (now part of Smiths Detection) and was responsible for new technology development and innovation, including the development of common software platform technologies for the CTX product line, the development of the CTX5800 and the TARDIS (now SCT) system concept and architecture.
 
Samit is recognized as an expert in the field of signal and image processing, system design, computed tomography, inverse problems, electrical engineering and software engineering.  He is named as inventor or co-inventor on over 80 US patents and has more than a dozen peer reviewed publications in high impact journals.  Software and technology that Samit has developed is deployed in hospitals, airports and critical infrastructure all around the world.
