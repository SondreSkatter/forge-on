# The Forge Culture

We are a tightly knit group of enthusiastic and energetic individuals, with a passion for innovation and 
our work.  Some of our projects are more about spreading this culture to our peers outside our
organization.

## The AI Conference

## The Self-Driving Car Challenge

The Forge ran a self-driving car challenge.  The goal was to foster an innovation mindset and get groups
across the enterprise to collaborate in a fun, competetive environment.  Each team was provided with a
reference car, and software to enable them to train the AI.  The winning teams rebuilt the cars and rewrote
the software from scratch.  Details are [here](@/projects/car.md).
