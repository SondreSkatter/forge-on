# Public Forge Projects

Much of what the Forge worked on remains proprietary to the parent company.  However, there are a couple of
projects that have a public presence, and we can provide some details on those.

## John Crane Sense

>John Crane’s long experience in preventing and 
>remediating leaks will enable us 
>to play a leading role in customer decarbonisation
>through our methane initiative.

>Methane is the most potent current
>contributor to global warming. With the oil
>& gas sector set to continue playing a key
>role in the energy supply chain, reducing
>methane emissions is a critical step
>towards Net Zero. Pursuing all mitigation
>measures now could slow the rate of near
>term global warming by as much as 30%,
>potentially reducing total warming by a half
>degree by the end of the century.
>Systematic measuring, mitigation and
>monitoring to limit methane emissions
>will be required by the sector to meet
>decarbonisation goals.
>
>Working with the Smiths *Digital Forge*,
>John Crane is developing technology and
>services to meet this need, which can be
>deployed across a range of environments
>from pipelines and plants to offshore rigs,
>in order to provide data to customers that
>will enable them to monitor methane leaks
>from sources over time and take corrective
>action. Multiple solutions are being
>developed to enable affordable technology
>and the ability to detect methane leaks in
>remote and hazardous locations.

>Our Digital Forge centre of excellence
>in the San Francisco Bay area, opened
>in 2018, is accelerating digital projects
>and providing a co-innovation space for
>us, our customers and other partners.
>John Crane Sense™ is one example of
>the collaboration between the Digital
>Forge and John Crane.

>Sense is a platform utilising sensors
>and software that allow customers to
>optimise performance and improve
>reliability. Working with John Crane
>experts, the Digital Forge has
>developed sophisticated machine
>learning algorithms that monitor seal
>performance, diagnose root causes
>of equipment issues, and predict and
>prevent potential failures.

>John Crane experts build sensors into
>seals and integrate sensors with the
>surrounding equipment to capture
>critical data. The Digital Forge developed
>the technical infrastructure to move
>this data to a highly secure cloud-based
>server where it is processed using the
>latest algorithms and then stored for
>visualisation and continuous analysis
>over the life of the asset. Customers can
>also access all of their own unique
>information and gain valuable insights
>via this secure web browser based solution.

>Our innovation framework is enabling
>increased collaboration such as this
>across Smiths and extends to external
>partnerships. In FY2019 we entered
>into new partnerships with leading
>universities to help share ideas and
>create innovations for the future.
