# Technology Risk Mitigation

"Differentiated new products and services
are critical to our success. We may be unable
to maintain technological differentiation
or to meet customers’ needs and may face
disruptive innovation by a competitor."

"Digital Forge works to accelerate digital
transformation across the Group"

# Technology and Innovation

"Digital Forge
Our Digital Forge centre of excellence
opened in 2018 and is accelerating the
growth of digital products in our portfolio
and driving efficiency and speed through
common development and common
platforms and tools that can be repurposed
across Smiths product lines. The Digital
Forge is sponsored by our Chief Executive
and the Smiths Digital Advisory Committee
(comprising members of the Smiths
Executive Committee) determines strategy
and governs our digital activities.
The Forge is predominantly focused on
developing bespoke interface solutions
that digitise products by connecting them
to the internet/cloud and enabling the
flow of data with a high degree of cyber
security. This has included smart products
at Smiths Medical and John Crane
SenseTM condition-based seal monitoring
technology, for which capability has
been significantly extended in FY2020 to
support large scale, high volume and highpressure dry gas seals.
Future development includes smart heater
interfaces for Flex-Tek and methane
monitoring products."
